# ✅DIAGRAMS & BUILDING BLOCKS:

## UML (Unified Modeling Language):
UML is a standard way to visualize system design using diagrams.Used to:
Explain architecture
Communicate design
Convert requirements → code structure

## CLASS DIAGRAM :
Shows the static structure of the system:
```js
+ Public
- Private
# Protected
+------------------+
|     ClassName    |
+------------------+
| - attribute      |
| - attribute      |
+------------------+
| + method()       |
| + method()       |
+------------------+
```

Relationships

## CLASS RELATIONSHIPS
Association:Basic relationship where one class uses or knows another.
User ------ Order
Aggregation:One class contains another, but both can exist independently.
Team ◇----- Player
Composition:Child class cannot exist without parent.
Order ◆----- OrderItem
Inheritance (IS‑A):One class inherits properties from another.
AdminUser
    ▲
    |
   User
Dependency :Class depends on another temporarily (method call).
OrderService ---> PaymentService

## SEQUENCE DIAGRAM:Shows interaction over time between objects.

## COMPONENT DIAGRAM:Shows high‑level system components and their dependencies.
## USE CASE DIAGRAM:Shows user actions and system capabilities.

## List of Building Blocks
### 1️⃣ Client:
Client is the request initiator that interacts with the system.it sends request and receive response
### 2️⃣ Server / Backend Service:
Server processes client requests and returns responses. Exp:REST API,GraphQL server
### 3️⃣ API (Application Programming Interface):
API is a contract between client and server.
### 4️⃣ Load Balancer:
Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.used to prevent overload
### 5️⃣ Cache:
Cache stores frequently accessed data for faster retrieval.Types Browser cache,CDN cache,In‑memory cache (Redis)

### 6️⃣ Database:
Stores persistent system data.
### 7️⃣ Message Queue:
Message queue enables asynchronous communication between components.it improve readability
<img src="./img/message-q.png" alt="messageq" />
### 8️⃣ Event Bus / Stream:
Used for event‑driven communication across multiple consumers.

### 9️⃣ CDN (Content Delivery Network):
A content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user. Generally, static files such as HTML/CSS/JS, photos, and videos are served from CDN, although some CDNs such as Amazon's CloudFront support dynamic content. The site's DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact.

### 🔟 Authentication Service:
Handles user identity verification.like JWT , OAuth ,session
### 1️⃣1️⃣ Authorization Layer:
Determines what a user can access.
### 1️⃣2️⃣ Configuration & Feature Flags:
Controls system behavior without redeployment.
### 1️⃣3️⃣ Monitoring & Logging:
Tracks system health and behavior. Metrics are Latency,Errors,Throughput
### 1️⃣4️⃣ Rate Limiter:
Limits number of requests per user or IP.
